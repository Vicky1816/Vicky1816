Developed a comprehensive Train Ticket Management System that streamlined the process of ticket booking, reservation, and tracking. Implemented user-friendly interfaces for customers to book tickets online, integrated payment gateways for secure transactions, and designed an admin panel for efficient management of reservations and train schedules. This project demonstrated my proficiency in software development, user experience design, and databaseÂ management.
